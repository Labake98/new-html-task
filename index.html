       <p class="details1">My name is Salami Barakat. I have nothing to write so i'll just write anything that comes to my head. My favorite color is blue so this webpage will be all shades of blue.
           So uhm i'm going to talk about what inspired me to learn frontend development, i initially wanted to go for software development but i read an article that a friend of mine wrote and i decided to change my track because i wanted to start small as i have no idea about software development at all.
           I got my inspiration from a friend who is also a developer and ofcourse after giving it a lot of thought, i decided to start learning i mean like how hard can it be? So far so good the learning process has been fun except javascript.</p>

<p class="details3">I also got enrolled in Stutern Graduate Accelerator Program. I was skeptical about Stutern at first because i haven't heard about a tech school that provides Job opportunites for the students.
    So after i attended the webinar and i got answers to most questions i had and i could not wait to start. I applied for Front-end Development, so far the class has been very interactive and the learning process is also good.
    I'll like to take you through some of the things i have learnt. Frontend development consists of  3 main programming languages: HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. I'll give a brief explanation of CSS and what it entails.

    SUMMARY OF CSS    
    </u>
    </h3>
    <p class="data1">
        <b> CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's a way to describe style rules that we'd like to set for our HTML elements. 
        Using CSS we can alter things like colors, fonts, margins, text alignment, and much more.
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        There are three ways to include CSS in our web pages:
Inline styling. This is done by adding a style attribute to an HTML tag. We will see shortly that this can have some unintended consequences.
&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;. This is done by using a style tag and placing CSS inside of it.
External stylesheets. This is the most common way and almost always the best practice
</p>

<p class="data2">
<b>SELECTORS</b>
In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

Selectors may apply to the following:

all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
elements specified by attribute, in particular:
id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix e.g. .classname
elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements.
An ID may only be applied to a single element.
</p>

<p class="data3">
    Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.

    For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.
    
    Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type.
